# Yoda Advice

## Description

Users will be able to receive sage advice from the venerable Jedi Master, Yoda. In addition to translating random pieces of advice into Yoda's famous way of speaking, users can also create their own pieces of advice for Yoda to translate. The most recent pieces of advice will be displayed on the page for reference.

## Installation

There is no installation required to use this webpage.

## Usage

Users can either type out their own advice or click on a button to randomly generate advice. Once either is done, a preview will be shown of the advice. If the user likes this advice, they can click on the translate button to translate the listed advice into something that Yoda would say. The final result will display as a modal with an image of Yoda and the translated advice.

After a result is displayed, the users most recent tranlations will be displayed on the page.
